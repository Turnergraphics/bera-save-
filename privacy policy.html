                    <p>We process your personal data:

                        4.1. To provide our Service
                        
                        This includes enabling you to use the Service in a seamless manner and preventing or addressing Service errors or technical issues.
                        
                        4.2. To customize your experience
                        
                        We process your personal data to adjust the content of the Service and make offers tailored to your personal preferences and interests.
                        
                        4.3. To manage your account and provide you with customer support
                        
                        We process your personal data to respond to your requests for technical support, Service information or to any other communication you initiate. This includes accessing your account to address technical support requests. For this purpose, we may send you, for example, notifications or emails about the performance of our Service, security, payment transactions, notices regarding our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy.
                        
                        4.4. To communicate with you regarding your use of our Service
                        
                        We communicate with you, for example, by push notifications or in the chat. As a result, you may, for example, receive a notification whether on the Website or via email that you received a new message on bera. To opt out of receiving push notifications, you need to change the settings on your browser or mobile device. To opt out of certain type of emails, you need to follow unsubscribe link located in the footer of the email, by contacting our support team at support@bera.ng, or in your profile settings.
                        
                        The services that we use for these purposes may collect data concerning the date and time when the message was viewed by our users, as well as when they interacted with it, such as by clicking on links included in the message.
                        
                        4.5. To research and analyze your use of the Service
                        
                        This helps us to better understand our business, analyze our operations, maintain, improve, innovate, plan, design, and develop bera and our new products. We also use such data for statistical analysis purposes, to test and improve our offers. This enables us to better understand what features and sections of bera our users like more, what categories of users use our Service. As a consequence, we often decide how to improve bera based on the results obtained from this processing. For example, if we discover that Jobs section is not as popular as others, we may focus on improving it.
                        
                        4.6. To send you marketing communications

If you do not want to receive marketing emails from us, you can unsubscribe following instructions in the footer of the marketing emails, by contacting our support team at support@bera.ng, or in your profile settings.
                        
                        We may also show you advertisements on the Website, and send you push notifications for marketing purposes. To opt out of receiving push notifications, you need to change the settings on your device or/and browser.
                        
                        4.7. To personalize our ads
                        
                        We and our partners use your personal data to tailor ads and possibly even show them to you at the relevant time. For example, if you have visited our Website, you might see ads of our products, for example, in your Facebook’s feed.
                        
                        We may target advertising to you through a variety of ad networks and exchanges, using data from advertising technologies on and off of our Services like unique cookie or similar tracking technology, pixel, device identifiers, geolocation, operation system information, email.
